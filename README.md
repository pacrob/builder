# Merkle Tree Visualizer

This project provides a simple interactive tool for learning about Merkle trees.
It is built with TypeScript and D3, using Vite for local development.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (default Vite port).

Use the input box to add new leaves to the Merkle tree. The tree will update
and show the resulting hashes. Styling is defined in `style.css` and can be
customized to change the appearance of the page.
